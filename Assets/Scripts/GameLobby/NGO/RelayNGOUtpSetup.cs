     * To use Netcode for GameObjects (NGO), we use the Relay adapter for UTP, attached to a NetworkManager. This needs to be provided the Allocation info before we bind to it.
     * In actual use, if you are using NGO for your game's networking, you would not also use the RelayUtpSetupHost/RelayUtpSetupClient at all, since their direct data transmission would be unnecessary.
     * We keep both versions for this sample to demonstrate how each is set up, whether you want to just use Lobby + Relay or use NGO as well.
